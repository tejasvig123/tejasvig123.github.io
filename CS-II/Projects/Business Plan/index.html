    <h2>Identity</h2>
    <p>The Symptoms Quiz is exactly what it sounds like: it tells you what illness you have based on your symptoms and several other factors. Simple and efficient, it’s perfect for when you don’t want to go to a doctor. The Symptoms Quiz is ideal for people who want a quick diagnosis that is accurate and offers ways to improve your condition. However, it is NOT a professional diagnosis, and for severe symptoms, we highly recommend seeing a doctor.</p>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>Picture this: you're sick and lying in bed. You experience unusual symptoms but don’t want the hassle of going to the doctor. You search online, but the results are far from what you expected. According to Google, you now have tuberculosis and pneumonia—something you know isn't true. This is the problem I aim to solve: inaccurate symptom results.</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>My solution is a quiz. But not just any quiz. I’ll create an extensive healthcare quiz featuring over 30 common illnesses, from the common cold to pink eye. The quiz will consider your symptoms, age, gender, past illnesses, and other factors to provide the most accurate result. Along with diagnosing, it will also offer options for treatment.</p>

    <h2>The Competition</h2>
    <p>A major competitor for this product is WebMD, a leading source in medical news and diagnosing symptoms. While WebMD covers a wide range of medical issues, this product will focus solely on diagnosing common physical illnesses, allowing for greater accuracy than WebMD in this specific area.</p>

    <h2>Target Market</h2>
    <p>The target market is anyone who uses the internet and occasionally gets sick. Unless you’re invincible, this product is for you.</p>

    <h2>Revenue Streams</h2>
    <p>Users will receive a free trial for the first month. If they are satisfied with the product and want to continue, they can subscribe for a low monthly fee of $1.99 or pay a one-time lifetime fee of $40. For now, as it’s a prototype, the service is completely free.</p>

    <h2>Expenses</h2>
    <p>Currently, there are no major expenses for this project since it mainly involves extensive research rather than relying on physical goods or special software.</p>

    <h2>Marketing Activities</h2>
    <p>Marketing strategies might include email promotions, YouTube ads, and TikTok skits to grab attention and engage potential users.</p>

    <h2>Team and Key Roles</h2>
    <p>Currently, the team consists of me and Andrew, a fellow student in my CS-II class. As the idea gains traction, I expect more people to join and help bring the project to life.</p>

    <h2>Milestones</h2>
    <p>As the product develops, I plan to add features like a body map to pinpoint symptoms and potentially offer video calls with a doctor in the future.</p>
