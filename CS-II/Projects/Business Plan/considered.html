    <p><a href="index.html">Back to ISP Proposal</a></p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/avanish-jeendru/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Smartshop</a></h3>
    <p>I considered this proposal because it's convenient for busy people, but rejected it due to the massive work involved in curating millions of outfits and categorizing them across multiple websites. Also, similar services already exist, like Honey.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brett-kaplan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">SchoolFood</a></h3>
    <p>This proposal saves time by allowing digital food ordering, which would be perfect for our high school with long lunch lines. However, it excludes students without phones, which I felt made it impractical.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/faraz-piracha/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Foob</a></h3>
    <p>Although useful for those lacking cooking creativity, I rejected this idea as I personally don't face this issue. Additionally, I tend to order out when I’m unsure what to cook.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/juneyoung-hwang/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Virtual Drum Set</a></h3>
    <p>Great idea for drummers, but I found it niche and personally irrelevant as I'm not a drummer, plus similar features exist in GarageBand.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/gautam-narayan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Low Frequency Trading AI</a></h3>
    <p>While a great idea for stock traders, I rejected it due to my lack of interest in stocks and the complexity of the project, which I couldn't fund.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/jana-daouk/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Thefit</a></h3>
    <p>Although this addresses a common problem of not knowing what to wear, I chose a different project because this one seemed time-consuming and required significant expenses.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/shivangi-gupta/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Cast Away</a></h3>
    <p>Although useful for trip planning, this idea was rejected because similar services exist, and I found other tools more efficient. If successful, I’d consider using it in the future.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/soohan-cho/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">The Bliss of Geese</a></h3>
    <p>While I loved the concept of a fun multiplayer game, I rejected it due to my personal dislike for Roblox and my own ISP idea.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/vijay-vemulapalli/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Child Detection in Unattended Cars</a></h3>
    <p>A good idea using temperature sensors and facial recognition, but I rejected it due to the rarity of such incidents and doubts about consumer interest in paying for such a device.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/tejasvi-gutta/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">The Symptoms Quiz</a></h3>
    <p>This is my own proposal, and I chose it because it directly addresses the issue of inaccurate symptom results that I often encounter. It will provide a more reliable, accurate alternative to current solutions.</p>
