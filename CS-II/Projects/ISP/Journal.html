        <p><strong>17 April 2023</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Personal Plans:</strong> My plans for this week for the ISP are to get the Cold, Flu, and Allergies page fully working with proper Javascript. I want the results to be as accurate as possible, using if conditions and loops. I’m not sure where to start, so I will ask my dad for advice. This will help our project, as these are common illnesses, and making an accurate quiz will make it more appealing and trustworthy.</p>

        <p><strong>Technical Challenges:</strong> My stylesheet wasn't working with the button I added on index.html. After consulting a classmate, I fixed a couple of typos and syntax errors. I also need help improving the accuracy of the quiz results, so I plan to ask my dad for assistance.</p>
        <p><strong>Scheduling Challenges:</strong> I missed work on Thursday due to a doctor's appointment and ended up too tired to continue.</p>
        <p><strong>Interpersonal Challenges:</strong> One teammate hasn’t completed their tasks for CS, which is concerning with the ISP deadline approaching.</p>
